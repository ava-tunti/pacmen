## Pacmen Project - Ava Tunti
# Factory for making pacmen
This program serves as a PacMen factory, allowing you to populate the screen with as many PacMen as you desire. Once the program is initiated, the PacMen will move at random speeds, creating a dynamic and entertaining display. You have the flexibility to add more PacMen while the program is running.
